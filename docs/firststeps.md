# First Steps

When joining a server for the first time, you can either join an existing faction or create your own.

Joining a faction involves fewer steps, as you just need to use the join command, so let's go your own way.

## Make your faction

Time to make your own new faction! The create command lets you set the faction's name:

`/f create koolkids`

Awesome! Now koolkids is a real faction and you're its leader! Let's give it a good description:

`/f desc Where all the kool kids hang out`

Very intimidating! Time to really intimidate with a quality base. Find a good looking chunk and claim it.

`/f claim`

You are now the proud owner of a chunk! Build yourself a little house, maybe put a bed inside, and set faction home.

`/f sethome`

Now, your faction members can teleport to this location to go back to the base. Wait! You need members!

`/f invite jeb_`

If he so chooses, jeb_ can now `/f join koolkids` and be a part of your faction!

There are many more commands in Factions, detailed on the next page.
